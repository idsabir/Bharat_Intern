            <h3>Temperature Converter</h3>
            <p>Description of the project. Temperature, measure of hotness or coldness expressed in terms of any of several arbitrary scales, such as Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness of an object. When we talk about something feeling hot (like the soup we drink when were sick) or cold (like the snow, especially if youre not wearing gloves), were talking about temperature.</li>
                <li>The temperature of an object, usually measured in degrees-Fahrenheit or degrees-Celsius, tells us how much heat, or energy, the object has. A boiling cup of water has very active molecules moving around very quickly and producing the heat we feel on our hands and faces. Colder objects don't have as much energy. Their molecules are much less active.</li>
